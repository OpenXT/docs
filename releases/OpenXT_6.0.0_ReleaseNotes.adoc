Known Issues
------------

Known issues and workarounds for OpenXT v6.0.0


==== Ubuntu 15.10 (and later) DVD VM boot failure.

Ubuntu Live and Full install DVDs fail to boot in VMs.

Workaround:

Use the Ubuntu MinimalCD network installation:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-431

==== Broadcom NetXtreme M5722 Ethernet PCI Pass-through.

This NIC is known to cause BSODs in Windows guests and cannot currently
be used for pass-through in OpenXT.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-453

==== Anaconda installer failure during VM installation.

This effects distributions that use Anaconda (e.g. Fedora and CentOS). The
underlying problem is an interoperability issue between the guest device
model and the bochs_drm driver that is being loaded during the install.

- Workaround to install CentOS:
* Press tab on the CD bootloader screen
* Add " bochs_drm.blacklist=yes" to the kernel command line
* Press enter
* Once the installer starts, switch on eth0 in "NETWORK & HOST NAME"
* Install
- Workaround to install Fedora:
* Press tab on the CD bootloader screen
* Add " bochs_drm.fbdev=false" to the kernel command line
* Press enter
* Once the installer starts, switch on eth0 in "NETWORK & HOST NAME"
* Install

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-485

==== The CD auto-assign feature is disabled for the 6.0 release.

CDROM auto-assign has been completely disabled, as well as the "CDROM install"
option in the VM creation wizard. The only way to assign a CDROM to a guest
is to do so manually in the Devices window. The "Always Us With This VM" option
defaults to true, implying that assignments will persist across reboots,
enabling guests to boot to CDROMs.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-635

==== TXT/Measure Launch unusable on certain systems.

This may not be an exhaustive list but these are the systems where TXT and
Measured Launch is known not to work:

- Dell Venue - unknown firmware version
- Dell 7450 - A13 firmware version

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-388

==== Windows Update performance issues and hangs in Windows 7 guests.

This is not an OpenXT issue but rather a Windows Update issue that occurs on
bare metal installs as well. This is covered here to aid uses in getting
Windows Update to work. See the following Wiki with details on how to
accomplish this:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DC/Installing+Windows+7

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-423

==== Pass-through devices must be removed from VMs before physically removed.

Procedure:

- Edit the VM settings that has the PCI device assigned.
- On the "PCI Pass Through" tab, remove the device(s) in question.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-687

==== Cannot install VM from any CD drive during new VM setup.

Because of changes to the behavior of CD auto-assignment (see above), a newly
created VM cannot be started from a CD on the final page of the new VM wizard.

Workaround:

- Create a VM, on the final page, select "Create VM & Install OS later"
- In Devices, assign the CD-ROM to the VM, make sure "Always Use With This VM" is checked
- Start the VM

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-661

==== Installation of OpenXT may occasionally fail due to previous disk layouts.

This failure has been seen when installing on systems that had a previous
operating system installed like Windows 10.

Workaround:

- The install will fail after selecting to do a clean install.
- Type Alt-F3 and enter +root+ as the user ID.
- Run +dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda+ for a few seconds in the terminal.
- Reboot and restart the installation.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-710

==== Guest tools upgrade procedure

Neither the Windows nor Linux guest tools presently support upgrading. The
recommended procedure is to uninstall the tools before upgrading OpenXT.
After OpenXT is upgraded, install the new tools in the guests.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-752

==== Windows guest tools uninstaller prompts for reboot incorrectly

The Windows guest tools uninstaller pops up a dialog box asking if the user
wants to reboot shortly after the uninstaller is run but before the uninstall
process is complete. This can lead to a failed or partial uninstall if OK for
reboot is pressed too soon.

Workaround:

Wait for OpenXT Tools to fully complete the removal process, which will be
indicated by a Windows prompt to reboot.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-752

==== Extremely poor performance using Windows PV Network drivers

Due to changes, most likely in the Linux netback drivers in one of the
kernel uprevs, extremely poor performance can be experienced in a Windows 7
guest with the tools installed.

Workaround:

The workaround is to disable Large Send Offload (LSO) for the interface:

- Open Windows 7 Device Manager
- Double-click on Network Adapter - OpenXT PV Ethernet Adapter
- Select "Advanced" tab
- Select "Large Send Offload" property
- Set Value to "Disabled"

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-752
